# To-Do:
User input for add/remove functions, so he user can specify what to add/remove

# Conversation Bot
 I'm an antisocial SOB. As such, I coded a bot in Python that simulates a conversation with me, but badly. Yay.

 # How to use it:
 Enter anything. A question, a statement, etc. The bot will respond to it accordingly.

# Note: THIS IS A JOKE.
This is meant as a fun, passion project. The description above is a joke.
Relax.
