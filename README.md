# Conversation Bot
I'm an antisocial SOB. As such, I coded a bot in Python that simulates a conversation with me, but badly. Or perhaps a bit too well. Yay.

# How to use it:
Enter anything. A question, a statement, etc. The bot will respond to it accordingly. But not really though, because that would require more time and effort.

*Note: THIS IS A JOKE.*
This is meant as a fun, passion project. The description above is a joke. My slow desent into late-night insanity, however, not so much.

# Requirements:
- playsound
    - Responsible for playing audio without opening up the default music playing program. I think.

- gTTS
  - Google Text To Speech. Self explanatory. You got this. I got this. Positive vibes. My god, this document is horrendous.

# To-Do:
- User input for add/remove functions, so the user can specify what to add/remove
    - ~~Yeah, that can take a backseat. It's weird and I can't do it consistently enough. So, screw it.~~ 
    - You're an idiot, it works fine. But not really though.

- ~~Fix "show array" function~~ Done! Yay! I need some eats!
    - ~~Also broken, because I can't use a list as a key~~

- ~~Text to Speech (gTTS)~~ Done!
- Speech Recognition
    - I have a massive backlog of videos to consult. I might actually post all my resources when I finish this. 

- ~~Multiple Python files because organization~~
     - ~~Yeah. Why not.~~
    - So apparently this is uneccesary because the program is fine as is. Yay.

# Dev Notes (Read: journaling my slow loss of sanity because I don't know how to code):
1. I have an add function working, kinda.

2. JSON file is set up. However, I can't add/remove things from the file. Kinda annoying. Will seek both coding and psychiatric help after this is over. It's way too late.

3. 6/2/20, whatever the time is. Asked Reddit for help, waiting to hear back. May implement an audio component into the bot (ex: speech recognition, voice recording, etc). Will do research on that later.

4. 6/2/20, 9:13PM. Reddit responded once and never wrote back. To be honest, I don't blame them. Might have carpal tunnel. This has taken way too long; I might just move on from the JSON file.

5. 6/2/20, 9:20 PM. "Holy shit. What if I had a command simply to open the add/remove functionality in a for loop? Could that work?" This was a sudden thought I had. Not sure if it's legit or not. Also need to see if there's somewhere I can go for near-immediate answers, simply because one Reddit post is taking too damn long.

6. 6/2/20, 10:23 PM. Back at it again. Made a new Reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/gvl7az/ive_been_having_a_bunch_of_problems_with_my/), not sure if it will do any good. I dunno man, it's tired.

7. 6/2/20, 10:37 PM. Lol "it's tired". Might jump to another project and stop banging my head on a wall. How the hell does one learn to code good? If I weren't 16, I'd be kinda sad.

8. 6/3/20, 8:12 AM. Went to bed at nearly 12 last night. I tried to add another website to my web scraper, but it didn't seem to work. Whatever. I could probably use selenium to make a school web scraper, or even just a program that logs me in and registers my attendance. Maybe I should try Stack Overflow instead of Reddit.

9. 6/3/20, 8:18 AM. It kinda sucks that everything I want to expand this project with can't be done. Maybe I can have all of the other commands ("show", "add", "remove", etc.) from a different file. I gotta do more research on that.

10. 6/3/20, 11:13 AM. My spelling is atrotious

11. 6/3/20, 1:19 PM. Reddit came through on the editing JSON front. Apparently I should just keep it all in one doc. Seems legit. Will try and implemet gTTS today, maybe.

12. 6/3/20, 2:28 PM. Reddit was wrong or mistaken, not sure which. It doesn't matter. I'll probably just work on gTTS right about now.

13. 6/3/20, 5:08 PM. Just added text to speech. It sounds kinda lifeless, but other than that it's absolutey amazing. I might actually record some audio in place of text to speech. Hard to believe that adding text to speech was the easiest part of this project.

14. 6/3/20, 5:27 PM. Everything works great, except for modifying stuff. Reddit gave up (I don't blame them tbh). Will work on food and/or mic input next.

15. 6/3/20, 8:47 PM. Redditor came through in the end. Sorta. Adding stuff to arrays "works", in the sense that it adds it four times. Removing stuff doesn't work at all. But it's progress. Jesus, if only I knew what I was doing, this would take half as much time.

16. 6/3/20, 10:02 PM. Looking back through all of these dev notes, they seem to resemble some sort of wack ass journal. Perhaps that's what I need in life: to write down my thoughts so that I don't dwell on them as much as I do. Hard to say. The Redditor's pretty chill, it seems.

17. 6/3/20, 10:10 PM. Not gonna lie, keeping this log was kinda nice. It's interesting to see how my ideas come to me, even if so few of them were right. It's also rather disturbing to see how bad my spelling is. 

18. 6/3/20, 10:19 PM. The GitHub README page do be looking kinda fresh though, ngl.

19. 6/3/20, 10:20 PM. I've been thinking. Perhaps I coded this to give my friends smething to mess around with to remind them of me. This is a bit personal, but I may be moving out of state because of COVID. It's scaring the shit out of me the more I think about it. Deep down, I really don't want to leave behind my school and all my friends. I know I claim to hold a small circle of friends, but I still hold a wide ring of people I'm close to, because I befriend people (or try to, anyways, because being someone's enemy is more exhausting than being their friend). The thought of leaving them all behind is rather scary, and I don't really like to dwell on it. Maybe I should write something for flux on the subject, just to get it out of my head and on paper ("paper"). Shit.

20. 6/3/20, 10:26 PM. Perhaps I need therapy. Or maybe just a therapy dog. I lowkey love how this justtransitioned from my casual notes on development to a place for me to open up.
