# Conversation Bot
I'm an antisocial SOB. As such, I coded a bot in Python that simulates a conversation with me, but badly. Yay.

# How to use it:
Enter anything. A question, a statement, etc. The bot will respond to it accordingly.

*Note: THIS IS A JOKE.*
This is meant as a fun, passion project. The description above is a joke.
Relax.

# Requirements:
- pyaudio
    - Responsible for playing audio without opening up the default music playing program. I think.

- gTTS
    - Google Text To Speech. Self explanitory. You got this. I got this. Positive vibes. My god, this document is horrendous.

# To-Do:
- User input for add/remove functions, so he user can specify what to add/remove
    - Yeah, that can take a backseat. It's weird and I can't do it consistently enough. So, screw it. I can save and add answers. 

- Text to Speech
- Speech Recognition
    - I have a massive backlog of videos to consult. I might actually post all my resources when I finish this. 

- Multipe Python files because organization
    - Yeah. Why not.

# Dev Notes (Read: journaling my slow loss of sanity because I don't know how to code):
1. I have an add function working, kinda.

2. JSON file is set up. However, I can't add/remove things from the file. Kinda annoying. Will seek both coding and psychiatric help after this is over. It's way too late.

3. 6/2/20, whatever the time is. Asked Reddit for help, waiting to hear back. May implement an audio component into the bot (ex: speech recognition, voice recording, etc). Will do research on that later.

4. 6/2/20, 9:13PM. Reddit responded once and never wrote back. To be honest, I don't blame them. Might have carpal tunnel. This has taken way too long; I might just move on from the JSON file.

5. 6/2/20, 9:20. "Holy shit. What if I had a command simply to open the add/remove functionality in a for loop? Could that work?" This was a sudden thought I had. Not sure if it's legit or not. Also need to see if there's somewhere I can go for near-immediate answers, simply because one Reddit post is taking too damn long.
