# Conversation Bot
 I'm an antisocial SOB. As such, I coded a bot in Python that simulates a conversation with me, but badly. Yay.

 # How to use it:
 Enter anything. A question, a statement, etc. The bot will respond to it accordingly.

# Note: THIS IS A JOKE.
This is meant as a fun, passion project. The description above is a joke.
Relax.

# To-Do:
User input for add/remove functions, so he user can specify what to add/remove
Edit #1: I have an add function working, kinda.

Edit#2: JSON file is set up. However, I can't add/remove things from the file. Kinda annoying. Will seek both coding and psychiatric help after this is over. It's way too late.
